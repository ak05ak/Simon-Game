# Simon-Game
Simon game is a very popular memory game where you have to repeat the color sequence. In my project, user wins after successfully completing Level 10.
If user gets wrong at any level and strict mode is unchecked (unticked), then game resumes from that level only.
If strict mode is checked then the game starts again from Level 1.
I have used html, css and javascript. Sound folder contains audio clips which plays when player or computer clicks green, red, yellow and blue color.
There is also an audio which plays when player/user clicks wrong color button.
I have added comments so that user can understand my codes.
